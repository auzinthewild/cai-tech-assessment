## Overview

**Live Demo -- [https://cai-tech-assessment.vercel.app/](https://cai-tech-assessment.vercel.app/)**

This repo is my submission for the coding assessment. My goal was to complete the assessment using patterns that were appropriate to a larger-scale full-fledged GIS application, built (roughly) in a comparable ecosytemy to that used by CAI--namely React + ArcGIS SDK per the job description and our conversations--using good coding practices like readability, reusability, and test-driven development.

This is a small, self‑contained mapping interface that displays the **Designated Wetlands** layer, provides a **Layer List**, a **Legend**, and a **custom query widget** that lets users apply an attribute‑based label expression to the layer. It uses React and ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript and Esri's Calcite Design System for UI controls. It also includes one simple unit test for the useActions custom hook.
